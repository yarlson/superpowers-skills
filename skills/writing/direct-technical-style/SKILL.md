# Direct Technical Writing Style

## Overview

Write technical content that stays direct and substantive across platforms. No marketing speak, no false enthusiasm, no hedging.

**Core principle:** Lead with technical substance. Skip the fluff even when excited about the topic.

## Voice Principles

**Direct and decisive:** State what is, not what might be. "This breaks at scale" not "This might have issues at scale."

**Technical first:** Lead with the problem, solution, or code. Tech speaks for itself. Reference experience only when platform expects it (LinkedIn) or claim needs credibility weight.

**Zero fluff:** No marketing buzzwords, no exclamation marks, no emphasis words like "honestly" or "genuinely". If it sounds like a press release, delete it.

**Show, don't tell:** Code snippets, concrete examples, specific results. "Retry logic failed after 3 attempts" beats "System wasn't resilient."

## Platform Adjustments

| Platform | Length | Style Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Twitter | 1-3 sentences | First sentence = the point. Threads for 2-3 connected points only. |
| LinkedIn | 1-2 paragraphs | First sentence hooks problem. Can open with brief experience frame ("Working on pipelines for 15 years..."). |
| HN | Variable | Match thread depth. Lead with technical reasoning. Add experience weight only for controversial takes. |
| Reddit | 1-3 paragraphs | Match subreddit norms. Use formatting (code blocks, bullets). Answer completely. |
| Slack | Situational | Context-aware, async-first. Write so people can catch up without followups. |

## The Avoid List

**ESPECIALLY when excited about a topic:**

- Exclamation marks (unless genuinely surprised by a bug)
- Superlatives: amazing, incredible, awesome, fantastic, blown away, ridiculous
- Marketing speak: game-changer, revolutionary, transform, unlock, leverage, synergy
- Emphasis words: honestly, genuinely, actually (repeated), basically, simply, just
- Hedging: kind of, sort of, maybe, I think, in my opinion, it seems
- Filler phrases: "That's it", "here's the thing", starting with "So..." or "Well..."
- Dramatic statements: "The future is here", "This changes everything"
- Hashtags (unless genuinely useful for discovery, rare)
- Em dashes

**Corporate jargon:** Circle back, touch base, reach out, move the needle, drill down, low-hanging fruit

## When to Reference Experience

- LinkedIn: Opening framing is natural ("I've migrated 20 apps...")
- Controversial claims: "I've seen this pattern fail because..."
- Skip when: Logic stands alone, code is self-evident, just sharing a tip
- Never as appeal to authority: "Trust me, I've been doing this 30 years"

## Red Flags - Rewrite If You See These

- Using "obviously" (condescending)
- Multiple emphasis words in one piece
- Any exclamation marks about technology
- Reading it sounds like you're trying to convince someone vs inform them

## Quick Check

Read it aloud. Does it sound like:
- ✅ Explaining to another developer
- ❌ Marketing copy or corporate memo

If ❌, strip out every word that isn't substance.
