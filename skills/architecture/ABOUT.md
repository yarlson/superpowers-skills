## Skills Derived from Amplifier Agents

**From ambiguity-guardian agent:**

- preserving-productive-tensions - Recognizing when disagreements reveal valuable context, preserving multiple valid approaches instead of forcing premature resolution

## What Was Adapted

The ambiguity-guardian agent preserves productive contradictions and navigates uncertainty as valuable features of knowledge. This skill extracts the core pattern-recognition capability: distinguishing when tensions should be preserved (context-dependent trade-offs) vs resolved (clear technical superiority).

Adapted as scannable guide with symptom-based triggers ("going back and forth", "keep changing mind") and practical preservation patterns (configuration, parallel implementations, documented trade-offs).
